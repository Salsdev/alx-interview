# 0x02. Minimum Operations

## Description

This project focuses on optimizing text manipulation operations. The goal is to find the minimum number of "Copy All" and "Paste" operations needed to generate a file with exactly `n` 'H' characters, starting from a file containing just one 'H'.

- **Prototype:** `def minOperations(n):`
- **Return value:** Integer representing the minimum number of operations required, or 0 if it's impossible to achieve `n` H characters.
- **Programming language:** Python
